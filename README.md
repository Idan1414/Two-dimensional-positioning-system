# Two-dimensional positioning system

This project provides a two-dimensional positioning system that can be used to map airplanes, football players, or any other objects that require spatial mapping. It allows you to perform various operations such as adding points, finding the closest points, and sorting points in X-order or Y-order.

**Activation Steps**

1. Download the ZIP.
2. Open the project in Eclipse/intelliJ/etc...
3. Run the GUI.
4. In the GUI, in the "Input Menu" , load the TXT file and the Image (Football,Planes,Friends, etc...)
5. Use the functions as you wish, you can add point, find the closest points, and get the points in X-order or Y-order as you wish.
